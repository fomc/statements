The Federal Reserve has made the following decisions to implement the monetary
policy stance announced by the Federal Open Market Committee in its statement
on December 16, 2015:

* The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to
raise the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances to 0.50
percent, effective December 17, 2015.
 
* As part of its policy decision, the Federal Open Market Committee voted to
authorize and direct the Open Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Open
Market Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:1

"Effective December 17, 2015, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the
Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal
funds rate in a target range of 1/4 to 1/2 percent, including: (1) overnight
reverse repurchase operations (and reverse repurchase operations with
maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday,
or similar trading conventions) at an offering rate of 0.25 percent, in amounts
limited only by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the System
Open Market Account that are available for such operations and by a
per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day; and (2) term reverse repurchase
operations to the extent approved in the resolution on term RRP operations
approved by the Committee at its March 17-18, 2015, meeting.

The Committee directs the Desk to continue rolling over maturing Treasury
securities at auction and to continue reinvesting principal payments on all
agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed
securities. The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and
coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal
Reserve's agency mortgage-backed securities transactions."

More information regarding open market operations may be found on the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York's website.

* In a related action, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
voted unanimously to approve a 1/4 percentage point increase in the discount
rate (the primary credit rate) to 1.00 percent, effective December 17, 2015. In
taking this action, the Board approved requests submitted by the Boards of
Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland,
Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco.

This information will be updated as appropriate to reflect decisions of the

policy.
