In response to the reemergence of strains in U.S. dollar short-term funding
markets in Europe, the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the European
Central Bank, the Federal Reserve, and the Swiss National Bank are announcing
the reestablishment of temporary U.S. dollar liquidity swap facilities. These
facilities are designed to help improve liquidity conditions in U.S. dollar
funding markets and to prevent the spread of strains to other markets and
financial centers. The Bank of Japan will be considering similar measures soon.
Central banks will continue to work together closely as needed to address
pressures in funding markets.

Federal Reserve Actions

The Federal Open Market Committee has authorized temporary reciprocal currency
arrangements (swap lines) with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the
European Central Bank (ECB), and the Swiss National Bank. The arrangements with
the Bank of England, the ECB, and the Swiss National Bank will provide these
central banks with the capacity to conduct tenders of U.S. dollars in their
local markets at fixed rates for full allotment, similar to arrangements that
had been in place previously. The arrangement with the Bank of Canada would
support drawings of up to $30 billion, as was the case previously.

These swap arrangements have been authorized through January 2011. Further
details on these arrangements will be available shortly.
